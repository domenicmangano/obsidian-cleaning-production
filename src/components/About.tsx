                <p>
                    Obsidian Cleaning is proudly veteran-owned, founded by two brothers who served in the US Marine
                    Corps. Their military background instilled in them the values of discipline, attention to detail,
                    and unwavering commitment — qualities that they bring to every cleaning project. With a shared
                    mission to serve their community, they’ve built a business rooted in integrity, professionalism, and
                    a dedication to excellence.
